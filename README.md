# SEO Challenge 

## Description

This challenge required me to update a website to ensure the HTML and CSS followed a well constructed, more intuitive format. The website needed to match the mock-up provided, while adhering to ADA and accessibility standards. 

With the updates, the HTML follows a more logical, semantic flow, and eliminates redundancies. This will make it easier for both other engineers to use the code. Additionally, with a focus on accessibility, this website will be available to end users with differing needs.
